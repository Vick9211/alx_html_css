                <h1>My passion for coding</h1>
                <p>My passion for coding has been a driving force in my academic and personal growth since I joined campus.
                   This enthusiasm was sparked by my friend, Raul Nyabola, who consistently challenged and inspired me to delve deeper into the world of programming.
                   Raul's relentless pursuit of excellence and innovative approach to solving problems motivated me to push my boundaries and embrace the complexities of coding.
                   As I immersed myself in various programming languages and projects, I discovered the joy of creating solutions and the satisfaction of overcoming technical challenges.
                   This journey has not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a profound appreciation for continuous learning and collaboration.
                   My commitment to coding remains unwavering, fueled by the desire to innovate and make a meaningful impact through technology.</p>
                <h2>Why Coding</h2>
                <p>Since my high school days, the sight of computer gurus writing lines of code and hacking always gave me goosebumps.
                   The intricate dance of characters on their screens and the power they wielded through code captivated my imagination. 
                   I was fascinated by how they could create complex systems, solve problems, and even protect against cyber threats, 
                   all through the art of programming. This fascination turned into a burning desire to understand the magic
                   behind those lines of code. As I began to learn and practice coding myself, I realized it was not just about writing code
                   but about creating solutions and innovations that could change the world. 
                   The thrill of coding, combined with its limitless possibilities, cemented my decision to pursue it passionately.</p>
                <h3>The way forward</h3>
                <p>The way forward for me is clear. I am committed to dedicating two hours of deep focus each day to writing code.
                   By setting aside this time daily, I aim to immerse myself fully in the practice and continuously enhance my skills.
                   This focused approach will allow me to tackle complex coding challenges and steadily improve my problem-solving abilities. 
                   Consistency is key, and by maintaining this disciplined schedule, I believe I can make significant progress in my coding journey.
                   I plan to use this time not only to work on personal projects but also to explore new programming languages and techniques. 
                   With this structured plan, I am confident that I will achieve my goal of becoming a proficient and innovative coder</p>
                <h4>How do I handle it now?</h4>
                <p>How do I handle it now? Consistency will be key in my journey towards becoming a front-end developer.
                   To ensure steady progress, I will dedicate a specific time each day solely to coding and refining my skills.
                   By focusing on building and enhancing my projects, I can steadily improve my understanding of front-end technologies. 
                   I'll also take advantage of online resources and communities to stay updated on the latest trends and best practices.
                   Regularly challenging myself with new projects and seeking feedback will be crucial for my growth.
                   Through this disciplined and consistent approach, I am confident that I will evolve into a proficient and creative front-end developer</p>
